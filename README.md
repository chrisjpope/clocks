# clocks
Attempt to develop a number of different clocks using HTML, CSS and JS.

# Clock projects
## Simple clock
The first simple clock uses [The Andela Way](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/create-a-pure-css-clock-with-svg-f123bcc41e46) as a source for the code.

## Simple clock 2
The second clock created uses elements from the Simple clock project. The aim of this one is to show a simpler clock, without tick marks or a second hand.

## Hex clock

## Map clock
