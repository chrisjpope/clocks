# Simple clock
Starting with a simple clock from [CSS Animation](https://cssanimation.rocks/clocks/).

Originally started by copying and pasting different CSS and JS options, but eventually settled on the CSS Animation site for a simple clock.

Next plan is to recreate, then to alter elements over time.
