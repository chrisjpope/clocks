# Simple clock
Starting with a simple clock from [The Andela Way](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/create-a-pure-css-clock-with-svg-f123bcc41e46).

Originally started by copying and pasting different CSS and JS options, including from CSS Animation, but eventually settled on the Andela Way site for a simple clock.

I have made some minor changes to background colour to make things appear differently.

Next plan is to recreate this, then to alter elements over time.
